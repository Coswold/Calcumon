// FOR V1, IMPLEMENT PLAYER AND GAME CLASS, SUCH THAT 
// THEY CAN DEAL WITH A MATH PROBLEM AND ALLOW PLAYER TO ENTER A SOLUTION
// AND CHECK THE SOLUTION FOR ACCURACY
// AND ASSIGN TOKENS ACCORDINGLY

// Player Class
    // calcumon (INITIALLY)
    // tokens (INITIALLY)
    // health
    // attacks and attack costs
    // response input to a problem

// Opponent Class (Computer)
    // calcumon (INITIALLY)
    // tokens (INITIALLY)
    // health
    // attacks and attack costs
    // attack at random?

// Game Class
    // math problems (INITIALLY)
    // solution checker
    // token associations with math problems
    // assign tokens to players if correct solution
    // how to deal with incorrect solution condition?
        // 3 tries, skip option, new question?
    // players/opponents
        // track attacks and update health accordingly
    // track winner
